# MaMoDAfrica_Course
The vector genetics course explores the genetic basis of vector-borne diseases with a specific focus on malaria. The course covers fundamental concepts in vector genetics, including vector biology, population genetics, genetic diversity, and molecular tools for vectors species identification. Students will gain insights into the role of vector genetics in malaria transmission dynamics and the development of novel vector control strategies. 

Objectives

•	Understand key concepts in genetics.
•	Explore genetic methods and tools for vector species identification.
•	Understand key parameters used in genetic diversity and population structure studies. 
•	Understand genetic mechanisms underlying insecticide resistance in malaria vectors.
